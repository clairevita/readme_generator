  # README Gnerator
  ## Table of Contents
  Using the command line or terminal, the user follows several inquirer prompts to outline a mark down file, formatted for Github implementation.
  ## Installation
  In order for the app to function properly, the user must run a npm install. This installs all necessary packages.\
  ## Usage
  After the user runs an npm install, they can type `node.js` into the command line to initiate the app. After doing so, they answer each prompt providing their descriptions. After doing so, they select an opensource license from a list to ensure the security of their original code. Once they've completed each of these steps, they will be notified that they have created a README.md. Navigating to the appropriate file, they will be shown the original code that they've created.
